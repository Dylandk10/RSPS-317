# RSPS version 317
This is an education rsps.\
For new people this server has everything you need to get going.\
The build is very basic but fun to use!\
However, I do not recommend using this server because of the server threading problems and graphic delays.\
The server is also built on a file system instead of a DB so it would be best to add a SQL DB.
 
## Bugs
Right now this server becomes unstable when to many people log on. This is a result from the poor server threads in Server.java\
The graphics are quite delayed also, This may be another server threading problem though the client may also just be lagged.\
