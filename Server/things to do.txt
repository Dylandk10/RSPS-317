READ CAREFULLY! READ CAREFULLY!
This client is a V1 client meaning it is NOT SECURE! DO NOT SHARE WITH ANYONE!!!!!
If your computer has a virus or think it does text me before loggin on. This will prevent the virus
from spreading to other users(admin, mods and tester I have helping me). Don't worry this client is
virus free I promise. 
 
When I release the V2 client you may share with friends and test the server on your own time.
This V1 client will NOT be online 24/7 due to security issues, when V2 is realsed it will be up 24/7 
on a protected private server. V2 will also be just one execution file with out all the code attached.

Now with this V1 client text/call me if you wish to log on the server. I will take it down frequently to prevent
hackers/viruses. If you wish to invite a friend txt me. I will be happy to put the server online if any of you 
wish to play/test. (Online look up RSPS commands, there is commands to use for the server such as :master, :pickup, :tele)
this makes testing easier and faster. Also search online RSPS item ids - this will show you the id number for
any item in the game (ex: rune scimmy id - 1333). then simple use command ":pickup (item id Number) (amount)".
Any questions about anything txt or email me.

Lastly I need help with the forums page, if any of you know how to make forum pages let me know (its very easy).
They are free and online everywhere. Also if anyone could set up a paypal account for this server let me know. 
The monthly cost is about $25 a month till we hit 120+ players, then its $40 a month so donations will help me keep 
it online and running smoothly.

Happy testing!
